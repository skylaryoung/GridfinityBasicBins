// ===== Info ===== //
/*
 IMPORTANT: rendering will be better for analyzing the model if fast-csg is enabled. As of writing, this feature is only available in the development builds and not the official release of OpenSCAD, but it makes rendering only take a couple seconds, even for comically large bins. Enable it in Edit > Preferences > Features > fast-csg
 the magnet holes can have an extra cut in them to make it easier to print without supports
 tabs will automatically be disabled when gridz is less than 3, as the tabs take up too much space
 base functions can be found in "gridfinity-rebuilt-utility.scad"

 BIN HEIGHT
 the original gridfinity bins had the overall height defined by 7mm increments
 a bin would be 7*u millimeters tall
 the lip at the top of the bin (3.8mm) added onto this height
 The stock bins have unit heights of 2, 3, and 6:
 Z unit 2 -> 7*2 + 3.8 -> 17.8mm
 Z unit 3 -> 7*3 + 3.8 -> 24.8mm
 Z unit 6 -> 7*6 + 3.8 -> 45.8mm
